Please note: this README is largely for my own thoughts and rambling, and has very little to do with the project itself. For information on how to actually use the app and associated modules, please find or ask for documentation, good luck.

Definitely should've already made a git repo at this point.

Developing a simple node module/library for building and controlling DOM elements. The aim here is primarily to build a todo app, but I'm personally trying to get as much re-usable code out of it as possible.

Ideally, this will be re-written with TypeScript with a class based system, to make the overall feel more like a React style framework with simple vanilla JS that I can re-use in projects and freelance work. 

::Have now made a repo, happy days.
